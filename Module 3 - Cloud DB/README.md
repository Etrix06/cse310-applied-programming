# Overview

Teaching myself Cloud Databases, I chose Mongo DB and have been doing mongoDB tutorials.  


I wrote a simple program that keeps track of my Dungeons and Dragon Players as well as their Character names and Character Races. The program connects to the database where it can access the info.  It can then be added to, updated, and deleted from the program.


I wanted to learn how to access the database from my program as well as to have a cool way to keep my players information.

# Cloud Database

I’m using MongoDB as my database. Which is a NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents.

My Cluster has a Database I named Python, which holds a collection that stores the id of the document, my player’s name, their character name, and their character’s race.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE. 

The program was written in Python and I used Pymongo to access MongoDB

# Useful Websites

* https://www.mongodb.com/
* https://www.w3schools.com/


# Future Work

* Make the database documents display better instead of JSON-like format.  
* I would add more error checking and asserts.
* Maybe have it be connected to a website instead of displaying on a console.
