# Overview

Teaching myself Python while doing the W3Schools Tutorial.

I wrote a simple text based adventure that runs on the console.

The reason I wrote this software was to learn the syntax of Python.  To learn the variables, functions, expressions, conditionals, loops, classes, and data structures.
