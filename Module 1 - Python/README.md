# Overview

Teaching myself Python while doing the W3Schools Tutorial.

I wrote a simple text based adventure that runs on the console.

The reason I wrote this software was to learn the syntax of Python.  To learn the variables, functions, expressions, conditionals, loops, classes, and data structures.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
