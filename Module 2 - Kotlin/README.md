# Overview

Teaching myself Kotlin while doing the W3Schools Tutorial.

I wrote a simple madlibs generating program that runs on the console.

The reason I wrote this software was to learn the syntax of Kotlin.  To learn the variables, functions, expressions, conditionals, loops, classes, and data structures.
