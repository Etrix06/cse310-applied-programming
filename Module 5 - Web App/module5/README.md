# Overview

Teaching myself how to make Web Apps using Python/Django.  I'm Trying to broaden my knowledge of web development methods using different methods.

This is a basic web app with basic functionality, I wanted to have a web app that you could schedule a game session with your D&D campaign group.

I had never worked with Django before this and it was an interesting learning experience.

Here is the link to my youtube video on how it works.

# Future Work
There are several improvements I still need to make.
* Item 1 - I want it to be able to store the information in a database like SQLite
* Item 2 - I want to work on the design so it is better suited for mobile phone usage.
* Item 3 - Need to add a way to add login and authentication.
