# Overview

Teaching myself SQL Relational Databases, I chose SQLite3 and have been doing some tutorials.  


I wrote a simple program that keeps track of my food storage items as well as their vendor names and expiration dates. The program connects 
to the database where it can access the info.  It can then be added to, updated, and deleted from the program.


I wanted to learn how to access the database from my program as well as to have a useful way to keep my food storage inventoried and up to date.

# SQL Relational Database

I’m using SQLite3 as my database. Which is a SQL relational database that uses JSON-like documents.  SQLite3 is built in and included in Python.



# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE. 

The program was written in Python and I used sqlite3 to access the database.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Make the database documents display better instead of JSON-like format.  
* I would add more error checking and asserts.
* Maybe have it be connected to a website instead of displaying on a console.
